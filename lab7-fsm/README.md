## Part 1: Finite State Machine (FSM)

A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** is a mathematical model used to describe and represent the behavior of systems that can be in a finite number of states at any given time. It consists of a set of states, transitions between these states, and actions associated with these transitions.

The main properties of using FSMs include:

   1. **Determinism**: FSMs are deterministic if, for each state and input, there is exactly one transition to a next state. This property simplifies analysis and implementation.

   2. **State Memory**: FSMs inherently have memory as they retain information about their current state. This allows them to model systems with sequential behavior.

   3. **Simplicity**: FSMs are relatively simple and intuitive to understand, making them useful for modeling and designing systems with discrete and sequential behavior.

   4. **Parallelism**: FSMs can represent parallelism by having multiple state machines working concurrently, each handling different aspects of the system.

The main types of FSMs include Moore Machine and Mealy Machine. In a **Moore machine**, outputs are associated with states (see [figure](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/implementing-a-finite-state-machine-in-vhdl/) bellow), while in a **Mealy machine**, outputs are associated with transitions between states. This means that Moore machines produce outputs only after transitioning to a new state, while Mealy machines can produce outputs immediately upon receiving an input.

   ![Moore-type FSM](images/diagram_moore_structure.png)

One widely used method to illustrate a finite state machine is through a **state diagram**, comprising circles connected by directed arcs. Each circle denotes a machine state labeled with its name, and, in the case of a Moore machine, an [output value](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/c6/c6s1/) associated with the state.

   ![State diagrams](images/diagram_circle.png)

Directed arcs signify the transitions between states in a finite state machine (FSM). For a Mealy machine, these arcs are labeled with input/output pairs, while for a Moore machine, they are labeled solely with inputs.

## Part 2: Button bounce

A **bouncy button**, also known as a "bouncing switch" or "switch bounce," refers to the phenomenon where the electrical contacts in a mechanical switch make multiple, rapid transitions between open and closed states when pressed or released. This can lead to multiple erroneous signals being sent to a circuit. Examples of real push buttons can be seen below. (Note that, the active level of the button here is low.)

   ![bouncey button](images/bouncey4.png)

   ![bouncey button](images/bouncey6.png)

The main methods to debounce a bouncy button are:

   1. **[Hardware Debouncing](https://www.digikey.ee/en/articles/how-to-implement-hardware-debounce-for-switches-and-relays)**: Hardware debouncing involves adding additional circuitry or components to the switch or input signal path to eliminate or reduce the effects of bouncing, such as capacitors, resistors, and Schmitt triggers.

      ![hardware debouncer](images/debouncer_hardware.png)

   2. **Software Debouncing**: This method involves using software algorithms to filter out the noise and ensure that only a single, stable signal transition is recognized. Common techniques include implementing delay-based algorithms, state machines, or using timers.

   3. **Combination Approach**: Often, a combination of software and hardware debouncing methods is employed to achieve robust debouncing.

## Part 3: FSM debouncer in VHDL

1. Run Vivado, create a new project and implement an FSM version of software debouncer with clock enable and reset:

   1. Project name: `fsm`
   2. Project location: your working folder, such as `Documents`
   3. Project type: **RTL Project**
   4. Create a VHDL source file: `debounce`
   5. Do not add any constraints now
   6. Choose a default board: `Nexys A7-50T`
   7. Click **Finish** to create the project
   8. Define I/O ports of new module:

      | **Port name** | **Direction** | **Type** | **Description** |
      | :-: | :-: | :-- | :-- |
      | `clk`     | input  | `std_logic` | Main clock |
      | `rst`     | input  | `std_logic` | High-active synchronous reset |
      | `en`      | input  | `std_logic` | Clock enable input |
      | `bouncey` | input  | `std_logic` | Bouncey button input |
      | `clean`   | output | `std_logic` | Debounced button output |

2. The inactive level of the on-board push buttons is low. Periodically read the button signal, and if the value is high, start counting a sequence of consecutive high values. If there is an uninterrupted sequence of `DEB_COUNT = 4` high values, consider the button pressed. The counter resets to zero upon receiving a low sample. When releasing the button, the FSM counts the same number of low-value samples before considering the button released.

   ![FSM debouncer](images/my_fsm.png)

   Define four states for the FSM and an internal counter in the architecture declaration section to count a sequence of unchanged button signal values. Additionally, define a debounced signal required later for the edge detector.

      ```vhdl
      architecture behavioral of debounce is
          -- Define states for the FSM
          type   state_type is (RELEASED, PRE_PRESSED, PRESSED, PRE_RELEASED);
          signal state : state_type;

          -- Define number of periods for debounce counter
          constant DEB_COUNT : integer := 4;

          -- Define signals for debounce counter
          signal sig_count : integer range 0 to DEB_COUNT;

          -- Debounced signal
          signal sig_clean : std_logic;
      begin
          ...
      ```

3. Complete the architecture body section according to the state diagram above.

   ```vhdl
   begin

       -- Process implementing a finite state machine (FSM) for
       -- button debouncing. Handles transitions between different
       -- states based on clock signal and bouncey button input.
       p_fsm : process (clk) is
       begin

           if rising_edge(clk) then
               -- Active-high reset
               if (rst = '1') then
                   state <= RELEASED;
               -- Clock enable
               elsif (en = '1') then
                   -- Define transitions between states
                   case state is

                       when RELEASED =>
                           -- If bouncey button = 1 then clear counter and change to PRE_PRESSED;

                       when PRE_PRESSED =>
                           -- If button = 1 increment counter

                               -- if counter = DEB_COUNT-1 change to PRESSED

                           -- else change to RELEASED

                       when PRESSED =>
                           -- If button = 0 then clear counter and change to PRE_RELEASED;

                       when PRE_RELEASED =>
                           -- If button = 0 then increment counter

                               -- if counter = DEB_COUNT-1 change to RELEASED;

                           -- else change to PRESSED;

                       -- Prevent unhandled cases
                       when others =>
                           null;
                   end case;
               end if;
           end if;

       end process p_fsm;

       -- Set clean signal value = 1 when states PRESSED or PRE_RELEASED


       -- Assign output debounced signal
       clean <= sig_clean;

   end architecture behavioral;
   ```

4. Use **Flow > Open Elaborated design** and see the schematic after RTL analysis.

5. Generate a [simulation source](https://vhdl.lapinoo.net/testbench/) named `tb_debounce`, execute the simulation, and validate the functionality of enable, reset, and debouncing.

   > **Note:** To display internal signal values, follow these steps:
   > 1. Select `dut` in the **Scope** folder.
   > 2. Right-click on the `state` signal name in the **Objects** folder.
   > 3. Add this signal by selecting the **Add to Wave Window** command.
   > 4. Click on the **Relaunch Simulation** icon.
   >
   >    ![Internal signals simulation](images/vivado_signals.png)

   Your simulation should be similar to the following figure.

   ![vivado simulation debounce](images/vivado_simulation_debounce.png)

## Part 4: Edge detector

A positive **edge detector** generates a single clock pulse when the input signal transitions from low to high, while a negative edge detector generates a pulse when the input transitions from high to low. The VHDL code captures these transitions by comparing the current signal state with the previous one using `and` and `not` gates, outputting single clock pulses accordingly.

![edge detector](images/wavedrom_edge-detector.png)

```javascript
{
  signal: [
    {name: "clk",     wave: 'P.................'},
    {name: "clean",   wave: 'l...h.......l.....'},
    {name: "delayed", wave: 'l....h.......l....'},
    {},
    {name: "pos_edge", wave: 'l...hl............'},
    {name: "neg_edge", wave: 'l...........hl....'},
  ],
}
```

1. Add both edge detectors to `debounce` component:
   1. Define new entity outputs `pos_edge` and `neg_edge` as `std_logic`
   2. Define `sig_delayed` signal as `std_logic`
   3. Add new `p_edge_detector` process to the architecture body and define `pos_edge` and `neg_edge` output values

      ```vhdl
          -- Remember the previous value of a signal and generates single
          -- clock pulses for positive and negative edges of the debounced signal.
          p_edge_detector : process (clk) is
          begin
              if rising_edge(clk) then
                  if (rst = '1') then
                      sig_delayed <= '0';
                  else
                      sig_delayed <= sig_clean;
                  end if;
              end if;
          end process p_edge_detector;

          -- Assign output signals for edge detector


      end architecture behavioral;
      ```

2. Add new edge detector outputs to the simulation source `tb_debounce` and relaunch the simulation. Ensure that your simulations resemble the figure below:

   ![vivado simulation edge-detector](images/vivado_simulation_edge-detect.png)

## Challenges

1. Create a VHDL design source named `top_level` and implement a button-triggered 4-bit simple counter on the Nexys A7 board. Read `BTNR` button every 2 milliseconds and on rising edge of clean/debounced signal increment the counter value on the LEDs.

   Use component declarations and instantiations of `clock_enable`, `debounce` and `simple_counter`, and define the top-level architecture as follows. Use reserved keyword `open` when you instantiate a module that has an output that is not needed.

   ![top level](images/top-level_debounce_structure.png)

   > **Note:** The `clock_enable` and `simple_counter` components from the previous labs are required. Do not forget to copy both files to `YOUR-PROJECT-FOLDER/debounce.srcs/sources_1/new/` folder and add them to the project.
   >
   > **Note:** Use online template for your [constraints XDC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digilent/digilent-xdc/master/Nexys-A7-50T-Master.xdc) file `nexys-a7-50t` and uncomment the used pins according to the top_level entity.

2. Move `clock_enable` instance inside the `debounce` component.

3. Instead of LEDs, use a Pmod port of the Nexys A7 board and display counter values on oscilloscope or logic analyser.

   ![pmods](images/pmod_table.png)

4. Use iterative `generate` statement from the [previous lab](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/vhdl-course/tree/master/lab6-lfsr#part3) and extend the instantiation of `debounce` component to several buttons.
