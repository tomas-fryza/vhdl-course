### LED(7:4) indicators

1. Listing of LEDs(7:4) part of VHDL architecture from source file `top.vhd`. Try to write logic functions as simple as possible. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

   ```vhdl
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   -- Experiments on your own: LED(7:4) indicators

   -- Turn LED(4) on if input value is equal to 0, ie "0000"
   -- LED(4) <= `0` when WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

   -- Turn LED(5) on if input value is greater than "1001", ie 10, 11, 12, ...
   -- LED(5) <= WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

   -- Turn LED(6) on if input value is odd, ie 1, 3, 5, ...
   -- LED(6) <= WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

   -- Turn LED(7) on if input value is a power of two, ie 1, 2, 4, or 8
   -- LED(7) <= WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
   ```

2. Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file (`tb_top.vhd`) with asserts. Verify all input combinations. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

```vhdl
    p_stimulus : process
    begin
        report "Stimulus process started";

        -- First test case
        SW <= "0000"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (LED(4) = '0')
        report "LED(4) indicator FAILED" severity error;


        -- WRITE OTHER TEST CASES HERE


        report "Stimulus process finished";
        wait;
    end process p_stimulus;
```

3. Screenshot with simulated time waveforms. Always display all inputs and outputs (display the inputs at the top of the image, the outputs below them) at the appropriate time scale!
